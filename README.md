# wats4000-mtg-final

This is a basic Vue app that lets you search for Magic The Gathering cards with the MTG API.
Enter in a card name, Converted Mana Cost, or card type to search for cards. There will be duplicates based on how many sets the cards were in.
There is also a booster pack generator that lets you simulate opening a pack from the set you chose. Unfortunately the API doesn't fully support all sets yet.
